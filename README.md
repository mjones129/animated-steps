<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

It may go without saying, but it may not, so I'm just going to say it anyway, this is a WordPress plugin and intended to be used as such. This code won't work on its own, and will only work within WordPress if there are other dependencies present and configured correctly.

### Prerequisites

As mentioned above, this is a WordPress plugin that will depend on a few other things being in place. Here's a brief rundown of what's required:

* WordPress version 6.4.2 or later
* ~~ACF Pro vserion 6.2.4 or later~~
* ~~MilesIT Blocks theme (version unknown)~~


### Installation

1. Access your WordPress install and navigate to the plugins folder. 
    `wp-content/plugins/`.
2. create a new folder in your plugins director and name it `animated-steps`.
3. Navigate inside the `animated-steps` folder and clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:mjones129/animated-steps.git .
   ```
   Don't forget the dot at the end!
4. Activate the plugin in the `wp-admin` area.

<!-- How It Works -->
## How It Works

To create a default slider, simply insert the shortcode `[as]`. This will return a simple slider with 3 slides and buttons.
To customize the content of the slider, simply pass in parameters.

### Custom parameters

* `btn1` = `$string`
* `btn2` = `$string`
* `btn3` = `$string`
* `img1` = `$url`
* `img2` = `$url`
* `img3` = `$url`

Full Example:

`[as btn1="Step 1" btn2="Step 2" btn3="Step 3" img1="https://source.unsplash.com/random/" img2="https://source.unsplash.com/random/" img3="https://source.unsplash.com/yEW23jxVsNI"]`

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Register slider shortcode on activation
- [x] Import and configure GlideJS to power slider
- [x] Reload (or replay) animated SVGs on slider movement
- [x] User defined images without depending on ACF
- [x] User defined button text
- [x] Instantiate a new instance of GlideJS for each element with a class name of `.glide`

See the [open issues](https://gitlab.4miles.com/marketing/adopt-a-horse/-/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
